About the Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is related to video game sales, which includes the following features:

Rank: Ranking of the game based on sales Name: Name of the game Platform: Platform of the game release (e.g., PC, PS4, etc.) Year: Year of release Genre: Genre of the game Publisher: Publisher of the game NA_Sales: Sales in North America (in millions) EU_Sales: Sales in Europe (in millions) JP_Sales: Sales in Japan (in millions) Other_Sales: Sales in other regions (in millions) Global_Sales: Total global sales (in millions)

Data Preprocessing
Loading Data:
The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for inspection. Basic information about the dataset, such as the shape and column names, was reviewed.

Handling Missing Values:
Filled missing values in the Year column with the median year. Filled missing values in the Publisher column with the mode of the publisher.

Encoding Categorical Variables:
Used Label Encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format. Feature Selection Techniques

Removing Features with Low Variance:
Used VarianceThreshold to remove features with low variance. Created a variance threshold object and fit it on the dataset. Transformed the dataset to keep only the selected features.

Univariate Feature Selection with SelectKBest:
Applied SelectKBest with the chi-squared (chi2) scoring function to select the top 4 features. Transformed the dataset to keep only the selected features based on the chi-squared scores.

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):
Applied RFE using a linear regression model to recursively eliminate features. Selected the top 5 features based on the model's performance.

Evaluation
The selected features from each technique were evaluated to understand their impact on the dataset. Correlation matrix and heatmap were created to visualize the relationships between features and identify multicollinearity.

Conclusion
The analysis demonstrated the application of various feature selection techniques to improve the dataset for machine learning models. Key findings include:

Features with low variance were successfully removed, reducing the dimensionality of the dataset. SelectKBest and RFE effectively identified the most important features based on different criteria. The selected features can potentially improve the performance of machine learning models by reducing noise and focusing on the most informative features. These insights highlight the importance of feature selection in building efficient and effective machine learning models. ​​
